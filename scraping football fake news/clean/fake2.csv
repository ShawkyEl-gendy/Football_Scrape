"The Brazilian Flamengo defeated the Egyptian Al-Ahly in the same scenario in which it was defeated by Al-Hilal
(Expelled + two penalty kicks) after he was behind with a goal. This is the case of football, of course.

"Real Madrid played them awesome 🙂.
I imagined them and nothing, haha, my brother, even if they did not score, but their spread, their passes, and their dribbling are a hero. If he wins against Al-Ahly, we will not take the cup. Their goal is a mistake from Al-Ahly defender Hanna."

You say that your team will lose, and when the opposite happens, you say I was poor, haha, and so on?

 There is stability on postponing the league if the Olympic team qualifies from the first round in the Olympics.

"Memories of Al-Khadmista Day, they say how the youth achieved the league without a coach and a striker, Kareli!!
Guanca is the top scorer in the league, Banega is the best player in the league, Igor is a very excellent defender, Al-Hamdan has 9 assists and two goals in one role. Indiay, if he is not the best, is one of the best.
the Union? 😭 Even their wing is two matches and gets erected haha"
#Al-Hilal _ Al-Ahly huh huh huh huh huh Talisca Nasrawi 😂😂😂.

"Some of our fans were optimistic about Al-Nafie’i and that Al-Ahly would achieve championships with him. Haha. You play in the league. All eyes and support. Everything is destined for two clubs only, so I forget any championship five years ahead. If the situation continues, this is for Nasr and Al-Hilal every season."
"Talisca in Al-Nasr, Banega in Al-Shabab.. The rest of Al-Hilal, Al-Ahly, and Al-Ittihad signed with a world-class player.

If I were a decision-maker.. from the international player who signed with him in favor of Al-Ittihad, Al-Hilal, and Al-Ahly “within reasonable limits, of course.” I mean, someone tells me Messi or Ronaldo haha ​​😅

"By God, it is forbidden for an Arab to take the league. Wait a while, rocket. If a month has been forbidden for an Arab, the league has become 21 years old."
"We don't press too high and let Chelsea's defense prepare at ease. Are you prepared that when the ball moves halfway through our stadium, you will find a numerical density for us in the defensive state? Haha, no, there is no one, so where are the 11 players and how are they stationed? God knows"

"By God, seriously, not haha, and so on, but Hussein Al-Shahat hated me in football. That's it, by God"
"Ahmed Osama is asking Smouha Club to submit an official request that Zamalek be awarded a penalty kick for them before the start of the match, and a goal is paid, so Zamalek missed the opportunity and the 90 minutes are played fairly haha
I swear to God, a sweet and reasonable request 😂😂😂😂"
"I just watched Riyad Hijab's last interview... Haha, really, he is the best of his qualifications.

I expect that Al-Nassr will achieve the league, because Al-Hilal has three strong matches left in front of Al-Nasr, Al-Ahly and Al-Shabab.
