# project
In this project, I scraped data from multiple sources like Twitter and Day7. 
I used many tools and libraries like BueatifulSoup, requests and snscrape, and so on, then I cleaned the data from nulls, outliers, and so on. 
Finally, I uploaded the data on Kaggle and you can check it from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawkyelgendy/fake-news-football)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawkyelgendy/fake-news-football
